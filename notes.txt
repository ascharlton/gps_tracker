map tiles are downloaded with the pyhtno script to a tiles folder:

python3 download_tiles.py --bbox 44.3381 15.0630 44.2285 15.3488 --zoom 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19

total was 788M

if you want to copy them and update them to the raspberry pi use:
rsync -avz tiles pi@192.168.1.198:/home/pi/gps_tracker/

On boot gps_tracker/gsp_server.py runs as a systemd service and loads a web server on port 5000 http://localhost:5000
To view the keel camera run a browser tab on http://192.168.2.2:8889/cam

The Ip connection is provided when the usb port is initialized when the camera rpi zero boots

You need to manually start the chrome instance due to heavy resource loads at startup - need to look for a lighter browser options!
