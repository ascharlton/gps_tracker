map tiles are downloaded with the pyhton script to a tiles folder:

--type sat or --type osm
python download_tiles.py --bbox 44.3381 15.0630 44.2285 15.3488 --zoom 16 --type sat


if you want to copy them and update them to the raspberry pi use:
rsync -avz tiles pi@192.168.1.198:/home/pi/gps_tracker/

On boot gps_tracker/gsp_server.py runs as a systemd service and loads a web server on port 5000 http://localhost:5000
To view the keel camera run a browser tab on http://192.168.2.2:8889/cam

The Ip connection is provided when the usb port is initialized when the camera rpi zero boots

Chrome loads at startup on the localhost:5000 (gps_tracker)
